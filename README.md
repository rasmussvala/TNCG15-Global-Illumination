# Ray Tracer in C++

## Overview

This project is a part of the course [TNCG15 Advanced Global Illumination and Rendering](https://studieinfo.liu.se/kurs/TNCG15/ht-2024) at Link√∂ping University 2024. The project aimed to create a Monte Carlo ray tracer in C++ from scratch that simulates realistic global illumination featuring transparent, reflective, and Lambertian surfaces.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
 * CMake
 * VS 2022/2019

### Run it on your machine

1. Clone repo.
2. Create a build directory within the project.
3. Open CMake.
4. Select the TNGC15-Global-Illumination directory as the source.
5. Select the build directory created in step 2 as the build.
6. Press Generate.

Done! Now you can open the solution created in the build directory (.sln file).
